                    <h2>Degree</h2>
                    <p>The Bachelor of Islamic Banking at UiTM Kampus Kota Bharu, Kelantan, stands out as a premier program for several reasons. Firstly, it provides a comprehensive and specialized curriculum designed to equip students with a deep understanding of both conventional banking principles and Islamic finance. The program integrates core banking subjects with Shariah law, Islamic banking operations, Islamic investment, and Takaful (Islamic insurance), ensuring that graduates are well-versed in the unique aspects of Islamic finance. This dual focus not only broadens students' knowledge but also enhances their versatility and employability in various sectors of the financial industry. Furthermore, in Semester 4 I have participated in the Global Outsourcing Talent Boot Camp program organized by the UBM599 course. This course has taught me a lot in finding a job in the digital workforce.</p>

                    <h2>High School</h2>
                    <p>High school memories, especially those revolving around the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) exams, are often some of the most cherished and significant moments in a my life. One of the best aspects of these memories is the camaraderie built among classmates. As the SPM exams approach, we often come together to form study groups, sharing notes, tips, and moral support. These late-night study sessions, filled with laughter, shared snacks, and collective stress, create a strong bond that lasts beyond the school years. The sense of unity and mutual encouragement during this critical period fosters lifelong friendships and a deep sense of belonging.</p>
